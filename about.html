            <p>Hi, my name is Reza.</p>
            <p>Where should I begin? Oh yes, I love mathematics: long story short, I am studying mathematics in graduate school. I also deeply love music, information technology, literature, philosophy, history, and mythology. I am a hobbyist musician in the sense that I can play and improvise, and compose a little. Here, you'll get a bit of all that, and more.</p>
            <p>I'm actually in my early twenties, despite what the art above suggests. I'm a child of an Iranian father and a Malaysian mother, born into the diaspora in Singapore, and now I've moved abroad to Europe (to escape military consciprtion). As you'd expect, I speak multiple languages. </p>
            <p>I'm often haunted by a vague sense of destiny. Those themes appear in my lived experience and when I sleepwalk at night (yes, I'm a parasomniac). I'm diagnosed with two dissociative disorders, derealization-depersonalization disorder and dissociative amnesia. I'm not sure if I'll ever resolve this, but at least I will want to write about it here.</p>
            <p>Some of the most mesmerizing experiences I've had in my life were in cross-country running, at night, away from the city, dialoguing and philosophizing with the silent sky until inspiration strikes. I've also went mountaineering for days in the snow-covered Alps, solo. If I ever decide to quit academia, I'll have run off to a hideout in the Swiss Alps (with wifi)!</p>

            <h2 id="about-site-heading">About the site</h2>
            <p>This is an informal, personal blog. I intend to disconnect it from my other projects, being a more personal space, so don't expect it to be comprehensive about my research, etc.. What I will share here are casual opinions, and personal thoughts and feelings.</p>
            <p>I originally had a linktree to post writings, but grew dissatisfied with Google Docs, which poorly integrated LaTeX (even with extensions). Moreover, I thought it lacked personalization. Hence this blog.</p> 
            <p>The pictures here are all taken from the public domain, except the one above, which was drawn for me some time ago.</p>
