          <p>Hi, my name is Reza</p>
          <p>Where should I begin? Oh yes, I love mathematics: it's the first thing I think of when I think of what defines me. I'm generally interested in all ofthe hard sciences, though in particular I'd note that I'm a technophile — I've been coding for 7 years now. When I'm not in a steamy love affair with differential equations, you may catch me with a book in my hand, often something about philosophy, psychology, epic poetry or myths. Something people rarely know about me is that I've played saxophone since I was 12, both famous pieces and my own improvisations. I generally like Third Stream jazz and classical music from the late Romantics (Mahler, Sibelius, Scriabin...), although it's not exhaustive. I recently started composing a little. Lastly, I write fiction, on-and-off. Here, you'll get a bit of all that, and more.</p>
          <p>I'm actually in my early twenties, despite what the home page background says (it's old, but represents me so well I decided to incorporate it into my personal blog). I'm a stranded exile from my country after evading military conscription. Speaking of my country, I grew up in Singapore, though I had an Iranian father (hence the name, <em>Reza</em>, which in Farsi means <em>contentment</em>) and a Malaysian mother. I speak three languages!</p>
          <p>I'm often haunted by a vague sense of destiny and loss, and it's something that occurs cyclically in my dreams, both in conscious daydreams and where I sleepwalk at night (yes, I'm a parasomniac). I'm not sure if I'll ever resolve this but at least I will want to write about it here.</p>
          <p>Some of the most mesmerizing experiences I've had were from running up hills at night, pumped with wonder and inspiration as I philosophize aloud to myself. If I don't end up a mathematician, trust me, I'll get a hideout in the Swiss Alps with wifi (last winter I went hiking up Matterhorn in the winter, solo, a 6 day trip through the silver river of the Milky Way just above my head).</p>

          <h2 id="about-site-heading">About the site</h2>
          <p>This is an informal, personal blog. I intentionally separated it from other sites and accounts I've made for various projects. I don't want any users coming from those places to reach this, in general, so don't expect it to be a complete compedium of all my research work. </p> 
          <p>I'll probably add more stuff to this place. I was going for a 'minimalist' yet personalized vibe, trying to strike a balance between feeling clean and avoiding more corporate styles. I really just chose the main font because it felt funky and futuristic.</p>
          <p>I don't know if anyone reads this blog at all. Perhaps, I've made a website for nothing. But if you do, thank you! You don't have to tell me, but you made my day with your curiosity :] </p>
          <p>If you want to reach out: message me on Discord (if you know me) or at <a href="mailto:non.ergodic.system@gmail.com">non.ergodic.system@gmail.com</a></p>
