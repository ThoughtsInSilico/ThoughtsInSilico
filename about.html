          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Hi, my name is Reza.</p>
          <p>Where should I begin? Oh yes, I love mathematics: it's the first thing I think of when I think of what defines me. I'm generally interested in all the hard sciences, though in particular I'm a technophile — I've been coding for 7 years When I'm not in a steamy love affair with differential equations, you may catch me with a book in my hand, often something about philosophy, psychology, epic poetry or myths. Something people rarely know about me is that I've played saxophone since I was 12, both famous pieces and short spontaneous improvisations. I generally like Third Stream jazz and classical music from the late Romantics (Mahler, Sibelius, Scriabin...). I recently started composing orchestral and jazz Lastly, I write fiction, on-and-off. Here, you'll get a bit of all that, and more.</p>
          <p>I'm actually in my early twenties, despite what the home page background says (it's old, but represents me so well I decided to incorporate it into my personal blog). I'm a stranded exile from my country over 10000 km from home after evading military conscription; I did university in, and currently live in, continental Europe. As you'd expect, I speak multiple languages. </p>
          <p>I'm often haunted by a vague sense of destiny and loss, and it's something that occurs cyclically in my dreams, both in conscious daydreams and where I sleepwalk at night (yes, I'm a parasomniac). I'm not sure if I'll ever resolve this but at least I will want to write about it here.</p>
          <p>Some of the most mesmerizing experiences I've had were from running up hills at night, pumped with wonder and inspiration as I philosophize aloud to myself. If I don't end up a mathematician, trust me, I'll get a hideout in the Swiss Alps with wifi (last winter I went hiking up Matterhorn in the winter, solo, a 6 day trip through the silver river of the Milky Way just above my head).</p>

          <h3>About the site</h3>
          <p>This is an informal, personal blog. I intentionally separated it from other sites and accounts housing my various projects. I don't want any users coming from those places to reach this, so don't expect it to be a complete compedium of all my research work.</p> 
          <p>For a while I kept a Linktree for my write-ups, but lately disliked Google Docs' lack of customization and the poor integration of LaTeX to type in math symbols. I can use extensions, but they're shoddy, so why not just make my own site?</p>
          <p>I was going for a 'minimalist' yet personalized vibe, trying to strike a balance between feeling clean and avoiding more corporate styles. I chose the font, right here, because it felt funky and sort of techno, just right for me. Not sure if that makes it hard to read, though. I may rehaul this place time to time. </p>
          <p>I don't know if anyone reads this blog at all. Perhaps, I've made a website for nothing. But if you do, thank you! You don't have to tell me, and I really don't want to make a big deal out of it, but you made my day with your curiosity :] </p>
          <p>If you want to reach out: message me on Discord (if you know me) or at <a href="mailto:non.ergodic.system@gmail.com">non.ergodic.system@gmail.com</a></p>
