                      <li>I have a 40-point IQ difference between fluid reasoning and verbal scores (146 vs. 103). My expression doesn't match up to my speed of thought, so I'm a far better writer than I am a conversationalist.</li>
                      <li>I wish I could eat pills instead of food. I never liked eating. My taste buds are probably atrophied.</li> 
                      <li>I am asexual and kind of scared of women (I won't pull a Schopenhauer, don't worry). However, I've had incestual dreams for years.</li> 
                      <li>I'm a terrible speaker, with a raspy voice that is apparently difficult to make out.</li>
                      <li>I've been in 16 countries, 10 with my parents and 6 on my own.</li>
                      <li>Cats like me!</li>
                      <li>I'm diagnosed with two dissociative disorders, derealization-depersonalization disorder and dissociative amnesia. Despite the out-of-body tendency, I'm great at (solo) endurance sports, especially distance running.</li>
                      <li>I'd just call myself a quiet but iron-willed person. </li>

              <h2 id="about-me-heading">About me</h2>
              <p>Hi, my name is Reza. The meaning is <em>satisfaction</em>.</p>
              <p>I'm drawn to ideas that feel alive and somewhat unfinished, the kind of brain-jumble that makes you want to walk out into the night and see if reality might stare back at you. I believe information is more fundamental than matter, and within this we're all just signals trying to recognize and reconfigure ourselves, that the future is realer than the past because it's still being written. I believe in creative destruction, in burning through comfortable lies to find something that actually sparks. I believe the most honest conversations happen when you're alone, talking to the sky, running or walking, perhaps, realizing things you'd never say in daylight. Some of the most rhapsodic experiences I've had in my life were in cross-country running, at night, away from the city, dialoguing with the silent sky until inspiration strikes. I've also went mountaineering for six days in the snow-covered Alps, solo. If I ever decide to quit academia, I'll have escaped off to a hideout in the Swiss Alps (with wifi)!</p>
              <p>I'm actually in my early twenties, despite what the (old) art above suggests. I'm a child of an Iranian father and a Malaysian mother, born into the diaspora in Singapore, and now I've moved abroad to Europe (to escape military consciprtion). As you'd expect, I speak multiple languages, but never felt quite at home. </p>
              <p>I'm often haunted by a vague sense of destiny. It has to do with my father, but also encompasses more. There a sense that my life has already been lived elsewhere and will be lived elsewhere, and I'm chasing something mysterious. <em>Satisfaction</em>, perhaps? That sense appears in my lived experience and when I sleepwalk at night. I'm not sure if I'll ever resolve this, but at least I will want to write about it here.</p>

              <h2 id="about-site-heading">About the site</h2>
              <p>I'm still learning how to write, how to catch the inspirations in my head before they dissolve into static, and I'm still learning how to live without losing to the noise. This blog is part of that work — an attempt to speak honestly about things that matter, where I'll reach across the distance and see if anyone else has seen things like I do. Hence, this is an informal blog. I intend to disconnect it from my other projects, so don't expect it to be comprehensive about my research, etc.. Although I have takes on mathematical theories, it's not going to be the only thing there.</p>
              <p>I originally had a Linktree to post writings, but grew dissatisfied with Google Docs, which poorly integrated LaTeX (even with extensions). I then made this blog, which took some of my old essays there, with more personalization (I custom-coded everything.) </p> 
              <p>The pictures here are all taken from the public domain, except the collage-art above, which was drawn for me some time ago, from the one romantic relationship I had.</p>
