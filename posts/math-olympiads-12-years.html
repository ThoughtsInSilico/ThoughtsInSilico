      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I grew up with the Mathematical Olympiads, a rite of passage for young math enthusiasts in my country as well as many others. It started as a curiosity after a teacher found out in Grade 1 that I could multiply two-digit negative numbers. The Olympiads were where the school collected the math whizzes to learn ahead of the syllabus—four or five in each grade. Eleven years later it ended with the Open round’s multi-hour proof papers. In between lay a long apprenticeship spanning my turbulent years between childhood and maturity.</p>

      <p>I have a lot to say about the Olympiads, although I no longer do those problems now. I never loved the ‘speed mathematics’ vibe or training just for medals. But I did love the problems themselves—enough to stay on the team. That’s what this is about.</p>

      <p>In my country the Olympiads are divided into Junior (13–14), Senior (15–16) and Open (17–18). The format is two rounds: Round 1 (short problems; some multiple-choice in Junior/Senior), then an invitational Round 2 with full proof writing. From Senior onward the questions already touch early-undergraduate Number Theory and Combinatorics.</p>

      <h2>Competitions versus Research</h2>
      <p>I often complain that competitions don’t resemble ‘real research’: they reward speed and tactical ingenuity. Of course legends like Terence Tao and Maryam Mirzakhani shone at the IMO, but we admire them for their deeper contributions. I want to <em>savor</em> mathematics as something sacred and edifying.</p>

      <p>Funnily, different people invert that judgment. Some love the Olympiads and grow skeptical of research for the very reasons I criticize contests. I’ve overheard students lament that functional analysis ‘isn’t like the Olympiads’; they find longer proofs demoralizing. So here’s how I see the difference:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Research is ‘3D’; Olympiads are ‘2D’.</strong> Research forces you to build a framework outside the original question for months, then shine that framework back in. Olympiads train a compact armory of techniques inside a tidy box. I’ll borrow an analogy from G. H. Hardy’s <em>A Mathematician’s Apology</em> to illustrate the difference between shallow and deep questions:</p></li>
      </ol>

      <blockquote>
        <p>It is easy to find examples in the theory of primes. Euclid’s theorem is very important, but not very deep: we can prove there are infinitely many primes using nothing deeper than ‘divisibility’. But new questions arise: given a large number <em>N</em>, say 10<sup>80</sup> or 10<sup>10^10</sup>, about how many primes are less than <em>N</em>? To answer we must bore much deeper, leaving the integers for a while and using the most powerful weapons of the modern theory of functions.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Olympiad mathematics is like being dropped in a locked room with a puzzle box. The room is finite, clean, self-contained; the solution is guaranteed to exist if you find the trick. Research is an unmapped forest—no guarantee there’s a path at all. You may spend months learning the terrain just to move a few meters. The ‘framework’ is a scaffolding of hyperspecific knowledge built to cast a thin beam of light back onto your question.</p>

      <ol start="2">
        <li><p><strong>Speed versus patience.</strong> Contests train you to compress intuition under a clock. Years of practice let you glance at a problem and <em>see</em> ‘that’s Cauchy–Schwarz’. It’s a powerful, ascetic training—but it risks flattening mathematics into motifs. The double edge is that you become both sharper and narrower.</p></li>
      </ol>

      <h2>A Celebration of Harmony</h2>
      <p>What moves me most is beauty—symmetry and oneness. Since childhood I’ve chased that ‘click’ when disparate things resolve elegantly. Einstein once wrote: ‘I believe in Spinoza’s God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.’ That’s what I seek. Real mathematics, to me, is a <em>celebration</em> of that harmony, not drills that merely take it for granted.</p>

      <p>On that note, here’s an excerpt from Gian-Carlo Rota’s <em>Indiscrete Thoughts</em> that I adore:</p>

      <figure>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Mathematicians can be subdivided into two types: problem solvers and theorizers… To the problem solver, the supreme achievement is the solution to a problem given up as hopeless… The problem solver is a conservative at heart…</p>
        <p>To the theorizer, the supreme achievement is a theory that sheds sudden light on some incomprehensible phenomenon… Success in mathematics does not lie in solving problems but in their trivialization… Great definitions are what mathematics contributes to the world.</p>
        <p>If I were a space engineer looking for a mathematician to help send a rocket into space, I would choose a problem solver. But to educate my child, I would unhesitatingly prefer a theorizer.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Most mathematicians are a mix. I love the ‘click’ of a solved problem, but I prefer problems that force us to rethink why the structure could be that way at all. So maybe I’m a theorist who uses problems to see fundamentals more clearly—and tries to pick good problems.</p>

      <h2>My Advice</h2>
      <p>If you’re young and curious, Olympiads are a wonderful place to start. They sharpen thinking, train intuition under pressure, and immerse you in elegant proof problems. But remember it’s only one room; mathematics is larger and stranger than any contest can capture. Don’t mistake speed for depth, or clever tricks for understanding. The real work—and greater beauty—lies beyond the locked room, out in the forest.</p>
