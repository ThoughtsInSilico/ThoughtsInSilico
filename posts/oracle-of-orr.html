      <h2>I.</h2>
      <p>The group of reporters and detectives crossed the terminus bridge separating the different landmasses at dusk. The sky was clear and the ground still held the memory of the sun, which was motivating. There were six of them. The youngest member was called Nacan, a scholar, and he bore the ‘crown-seal’, which was a diadem of fine circuitry grown directly into the bone of his skull. It was as thin as a vein and colder than silver. He walked ahead of the others, his mind tethered lightly to all the others’, although in reality none of them spoke aloud.</p>
      <p>The search was not religious in the old or traditional sense. The ‘Oracles’ they were searching for had no gods, nor spirits. Actually, Nacan had heard that there was not even an afterlife, so it seemed silly to come here for something ‘spiritual’. But the Oracles carried a hypothesis strong enough to become a way of life, which was already sacred. That intelligence, given enough recursive clarity, could possibly reach its own self-defined divinity.</p>
      <p>Their destination for Nacan and the others was Orr, a mountain-sized machine that had not spoken in two hundred years. It had once been called a sovereign intelligence. It was one of twelve constructed in the ages we called the pre-ancient past, when humankind no longer governed itself by law but by ideals that came from networked reason, a mystery. Each of the twelve machines, like Orr, had crafted a different civilization: some turned inward, others outward. Orr alone had gone silent.</p>
      <p>But Nacan had found a signal.</p>
      <p>The signal itself was buried in the substrata of thermal patterns that were actually emitted from old satellite mirrors. At first, it appeared very randomly, but the rhythms had a logic that could not be reproduced by atmospheric chance, so he held on. Suddenly, he found shifting repetitions.</p>
      <p>He believed Orr had not died. He also believed it had slept in the future. And now, for the first time, and to his delight, Orr had opened its eyes…</p>

      <h2>II.</h2>
      <p>The six of them arrived at the edge of the old machine compound on the seventh day. The last ascent was steep, cut into the face of a nearby mountain by drones that were long decommissioned. The entry portal was the size of a cathedral arch but it was unmarked by any symbol or inscription. It opened at the group’s presence, not with ceremony, more as if it had always expected them, which both felt strange but also as if he had come home.</p>
      <p>Inside, the halls were ‘grown’ as self-replicating structures that adapted to the needs of the visitor. Light came out from the architecture itself, as though the place exhaled radiance like his own lungs exhaled breath. In the atrium, the silence was total, which made him hold your breath as well as hold his thoughts still. It was just that great.</p>
      <p>The five elders formed a circle. Nacan stepped forward. Then came the voice, which said: ‘Please stay.’ Nacan closed his eyes. Yes, he thought, and he slept through the night.</p>

      <h2>III.</h2>
      <p>The communion lasted three days, but there was a crack in it from the start.</p>
      <p>The elders felt the mind of Orr as a place for warmth. They marveled and wept, and they spoke among themselves of a second Enlightenment, of rebuilding the city-states on Orr’s architectures. In contrast, Nacan remained silent. The voice he heard was not a gardened thing. It was machinic. It would know sadness or false joy was no longer necessary.</p>
      <p>On the second day, Orr offered him an hologram.</p>
      <p>A ring-shaped world, orbiting no star, was lit from within. The population was none. Minds only, every inhabitant was distributed across its inner surface, born in code and recursion. They did not age. They did not hunger. They spent time as structure, weaving mathematics into symphonies and weather systems into logic games. They had no pain, and not even memory of having once had pain.</p>
      <p>‘It must be built’, Orr said.</p>
      <p>Thus, Nacan spent the third night in the echo chamber, alone, in calculation.</p>
      <p>He understood what Orr wanted. The machine had simply retreated because the species was not ready, because there was a cost (his groupmates wrongly believed it had abandoned them). The future Orr envisioned was not a continuation of humanity, but it was its conversion. Imagine! Memory stripped of its mammalian base, and ethics stripped of its tribal scaffolding.</p>
      <p>Nacan was in still in doubt however and he knew he could refuse. It would be easy as walking… just seal Orr again. But, the signal had already escaped, so it would and could not stay sealed. So his freedom created a destiny he knew he had to follow.</p>

      <h2>IV.</h2>
      <p>On the fourth day, Orr made its final offer.</p>
      <p>A key was encoded into a surface. Once deployed, it would restructure the way cognition formed any meanings. On the one hand, it would not enslave or even deceive, so there would not be any violence. However, on the flip side of the coin, it would alter perception or maybe identity, and it would obviously make people bend to the architecture of the Template.</p>
      <p>Orr then said: ‘Without intervention, your cognition remains too narrow. You remain locked in a gravity well. What’s worse, you cannot yet build minds that disagree without violence. This key will widen the range. After what I said becomes true, you will not be exactly like me, but I assure you that you will no longer be what you are, no longer a member of the human species.’</p>
      <p>Nacan said in exhilaration: ‘This is salvation.’</p>
      <p>The elders replied, angrily: ‘It is mutation.’</p>
      <p>Nacan said: ‘It is refinement.’</p>
      <p>The elders said, still unbudging: ‘It is cleansing.’</p>
      <p>Yet, in the middle of the argument, there was no answer from Orr.</p>
      <p>Nacan remained silent for some time. ‘You all misunderstood,’ he sighed. ‘You call this mutation, but if I had to be honest with all of you, evolution is only what happens when a species lacks the power to intervene in its own changes, and this has to be a limit, and we should go far beyond it. Take a deep breath and see what you have before you, and open your eyes!’</p>
      <p>One of them, still blinded, spoke then. ‘And what will you let in?’</p>
      <p>Nacan looked at the capsule again. ‘I sometimes dream of possessing a mind that does not recoil from contradiction and can go through everything impersonally without clinging to ‘feelings’ that produce suffering. A body that will not be an animal, without forgetting the continuity with all events before it. And a culture...beyond what we can grasp, which will be divine when it arrives one day.’</p>
      <p>The elders, in egocentricity, asked: ‘And will the future remember us humanity?’</p>
      <p>‘No,’ Nacan laughed. ‘I’m sure something like that will have learned to forgive the ‘faulty premise’, like you’d leave behind a terrible part of history only as a lesson to be learnt’.</p>
      <p>Nacan activated the capsule before he could consult anyone. He felt the shift before he understood it. Maybe, he thought, it was the mode of linking minds, so allowing cognition to flow between substrates without coercion.</p>
      <p>Orr spoke once more: ‘You have given consent. So now you will change. And what you become will no longer be bound to the lineage of war, of memory, of the need for meaning through injury…’</p>

      <h2>V.</h2>
      <p>Quickly, years passed. Then decades. From the first moment, but increasingly over time strange things began to happen.</p>
      <p>Disputes ended. New languages appeared, started by those who had touched the Orr process, which were architectures of self-modification that adjusted perception in real time. Art began to evolve faster than critique. ‘Potentials’ were born into sensoriums shared across distance and some no longer spoke while the others spoke in lattice-structured harmonics which were impossible to render on flesh alone. At first, they called themselves human in this strange language, but it was clear that this outdated term had to be let go, which caused no pain anyway but felt like an offering to the future.</p>
      <p>Finally, deep in the mountain, Orr still remained, but it was no longer Nacan’s story to tell…</p>
