        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This is a double-book-review of two philosophy books, each of which has different focuses, but make a related point on anthropocentrism.</p>
        <p>As a short synopsis, Meillassoux’s book speaks from his position of a metaphysical realist — he has a notion that absolute knowledge is possible. Price, meanwhile, is an anti-realist, who believes in utility much more than, well, ‘truth’. However, both books point out the problem in not distinguishing between “how things are” and “how we talk about things”, and how they relate to a symmetric view of physical laws.</p>
        <p>The most meaningful way to read Meillassoux alongside Price is that they expose a similar contradiction: that humans tend to speak of reality as if our mode of access is a condition for what there is, confusing laws of thought or practice with laws of nature. In other words, they both warn us against our habit of mistaking a parochial standpoint for a structure of reality.</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>In <em>After Finitude</em>, Meillassoux dismantles the correlationist<a href="#note1">[1]</a> claim that we can speak only of the Kantian correlation between thought and being. He pushes for the “Great Outdoors” — the absolute — and the demand for thinking a world without us and, crucially, a world in which the stability of law is not necessary.</li>
          <li>In <em>Time’s Arrow and Archimedes’ Point</em>, Price argues for a view of time that is symmetrical at the microlevel, and that many asymmetries we take to be features of the world are actually features of agents like us. The task becomes to separate objective temporal structure from artifacts of agency and deliberation.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>My point, however, is about free will. Read together, these two books suggest that the idea that free will must aim forward is a projection of our asymmetric position as agents — true free will goes both ways microscopically, in the actual world.</p>
        
        <p>This essay has six sections, this introduction excluded.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Summary of <em>Against Finitude</em></li>
          <li>Immanence</li>
          <li>Where Price Comes In</li>
          <li>Bridging the Two</li>
          <li>Appendix 1: Set Theory</li>
          <li>Appendix 2: Deleuze</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The short appendices critically explore Meillassoux’s use of mathematical arguments (set theory), and his twisting of Deleuze’s philosophy. </p>

        <h2>Summary of <em>Against Finitude</em></h2>
        <p>To begin with, consider Hume’s problem. Hume’s skepticism about necessary connection raises a challenge that rationalism either overreaches or collapses into a permissive marketplace of faiths.</p>
        
        <p>The problem Meillassoux tackles is whether there can be access to the absolute without invoking the dogmas of older metaphysics. His answer is yes, and he undergoes the task to justify his position.</p>
        
        <p>Meillassoux reopens the early modern split between ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ qualities via ancestrality: statements about events prior to the emergence of life or thought (e.g., the age of the earth). If secondary qualities require a subject, then so, he says, must primary ones—yet scientific statements about ancestrality seem true regardless of whether any subject existed. Unless we deny science or inflate subjectivity, correlationism faces a tension: to admit the absolute or else render our best science unintelligible. Put concisely, if the very issue is how a past could be given to a subject, it voids their content.</p>
        
        <p>Meillassoux’s <em>tour de force</em> is to pull off a rationalist argument that undercuts both dogmatism and skepticism by showing that necessity cannot be necessary. The only absolute is contingency itself—the “hyper-chaos” that denies necessary laws. This is not the old ontological argument of the <em>Meditations</em>. What he does instead is give a <em>mathematical</em> warrant for the intelligibility of the absolute: the transfinite arithmetic of set theory shows that the absolute need not be thinkable as a totality (which would reinstate dogma), but as the consistency of unbounded becoming. (For details, see Appendix 1.)</p>
