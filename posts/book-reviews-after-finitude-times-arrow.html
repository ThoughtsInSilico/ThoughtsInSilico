        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This a double-book-review of two philosophy books, with different focuses, but make a related point on anthropocentrism.</p>
        <p>As a short synopsis, Meillassoux’s book speaks from his school of speculative realism, refuting Kant and Hume, as well as those who lived after his critical revolution like Deleuze and Wittgenstein, to support the apparently-outdated Descartes. Price’s is a philosophy of physics book, discussing topics like quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, and how they relate to a symmetric view of physical laws.</p>
        <p>The most meaningful way to read Meillassoux alongside Price is to treat both as a two-front campaign against the same foe, namely our habit of mistaking a parochial standpoint for a structure of reality.</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>In <em>After Finitude</em>, Meillassoux dismantles the correlationist<a href="#note1">[1]</a> claim that we can speak only of the Kantian world–for–us, extracting from a thought experiment about ancestral ‘arche-fossils’ a demand for thinking a world without us and, crucially, a world in which the stability of law is not necessary.</li>
          <li>In <em>Time’s Arrow and Archimedes’ Point</em>, Price urges an ‘Archimedean’ stance outside our everyday temporal perspective, which he calls a ‘view from nowhen’, in order to separate genuine temporal structure from artifacts of agency and deliberation.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>My point, however, is about free will. Read together, both authors tell us something about the free-will debate: Meillassoux secures a mind-independent contingency of laws, allowing us to genuinely act in the world, while Price shows why our idea that free will must aim forward is a projection of our asymmetric position as agents — true free will goes both ways microscopically, in the actual world.</p>

        <h2>Summary of <em>Against Finitude</em></h2>
        <p>To begin with, consider Hume’s problem. Hume’s skepticism is that reason delivers, at most, the principle of non-contradiction, but fails to give a law that forces tomorrow to resemble today. He hence devalues reason, only to give value to conventionalism. Kant followed Hume. Instead of asking what things are in themselves, post-Kantian philosophy asks what forms of subjective givenness bind one’s own thoughts and the world. Twentieth-century heirs then elevated the media of correlation, through Wittgenstein’s language for analytic philosophy and Merleau-Ponty’s lived consciousness for phenomenology, and did it so thoroughly that philosophy ‘lost the great outdoors’, i.e., the mind-indifferent real. After Kant, critical philosophy destabilized theological and anti-theological dogmatisms alike: once the absolute is declared unthinkable, theological belief and unbelief both devolve into fideism (pure faith), since neither can be rationally grounded. Rational theology, like the western Judeo-Christian tradition, is of course challenged by the dominance of subjectivity, but absolute knowledge is also withheld from the subject. Indeed, Meillassoux surveys the classical options, such as Descartes’ objectivist mathematics, Kant’s thinkable-but-unknowable noumenon, Popper’s falsifiability that never allows laws themselves to vary, and concludes that the correlationist veto either strips science of its literal ancestral reach or collapses into a permissive marketplace of faiths.</p>
        
        <p>The problem Meillassoux tackles is whether there can be any independent existence outside the mind:. His answer is yes, and he undergoes the task to justify his position.</p>
        
        <p>Meillassoux reopens the early modern split between ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ qualities after Kant moved the issue from Cartesian substances to correlations, seemingly making objectivity obsolete. He forces the issue with ancestrality and the archi-fossil: scientific claims about times prior to life (radioactive dating, cosmic background radiation) are meant literally, not as disguised counterfactuals about human inventions of a past. He emphasizes that if correlationism reinterprets those discoveries as about what construction of a past could be given to a subject, it voids their content.</p>
        
        <p>Meillassoux’s <em>tour de force</em> is to pull off an improved version of Descartes without the latter’s faulty invocations of a perfect God in the ontological argument of the <em>Meditations</em>. What he does exactly is to extract an observation from <em>within</em> the givenness of subjectivity, then draw inferences that escape the subjectivity itself. Accordingly, the only necessity is the necessity of <em>facticity</em>, or <em>factiality</em> later in the book. That basically refers to the very fact that there is a world. Where you can deduce anything else, factiality cannot be deduced, but purely experienced. Here is the definition:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>What I experience with facticity is not an objective reality, but rather the unsurpassable limits of objectivity confronted with the fact that there is a world; a world that is describable and perceptible, and structured by determinate invariants. It is the sheer fact of the world’s logicality, of its givenness in a representation, which evades the structures of logical and representational reason. The in-itself becomes opaque to the point where it is no longer possible to maintain that it exists, so that the term tends to disappear to the benefit of facticity alone.</p>
          <p>Facticity thereby forces us to grasp the ‘possibility’ of that which is wholly other to the world, but which resides in the midst of the world as such. Yet it is necessary to place inverted commas around the term ‘possibility’ insofar as what is operative in facticity is not knowledge of the actual possibility of the wholly other, but rather our inability to establish its impossibility. It is a possibility which is itself hypothetical, indicating that for us every hypothesis concerning the in-itself remains equally valid – that is, that it is necessary, that it is not, that it is contingent, etc.</p>
          <footer>— <cite><em>After Finitude</em></cite>, p. 40</footer>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The structure of his justification goes like (A) the principle of non-contradiction remains binding, because an inconsistent being would be necessary (something is either X or not X, so some form of it must always exist), which is precisely what the absolute forbids, (B) there are no necessary beings or necessary laws, (C) non-contradiction, while binding on what is thinkable, does not legislate which consistent arrangement of laws obtains. Hence, the world need not be the way it is, and even laws can change, but this change itself is the original ground state.  </p>
                      
        <p>I think (A) is not hard to grasp. Even if one disagrees (ex. adopting fuzzy logic), it’s obvious what Meillassoux’s argument would be.   </p>
        
        <p>How is (B) justified? For starters, Meillassoux distinguishes chance from true contingency, because probabilistic chance presupposes stable frameworks (ex. a die’s faces, fixed sampling conditions) and thus cannot model law’s groundlessness. Genuine factiality can’t be modeled as draws from a fixed urn. Consequently, he refuses a world in which law changes according to a meta-law of stochastic transitions and instead pictures a time whose very capacity is to de-stabilize any determinate law without reason, which is what he elsewhere calls the 'lawless destruction of every physical law'. He draws from Cantor’s mathematical lesson that any given totality generates a strictly larger power-set, and argues that it shows why the ‘whole of the thinkable’ cannot be formed.  </p>
       
        <blockquote>
          <p>In order to be as concise and as clear as possible about the issue of the transfinite, we can put things in the following way: one of the most remarkable aspects of the standard axiomatization of set-theory (known as ‘ZF’, for ‘Zermelo-Fraenkel’), progressively elaborated during the first half of the twentieth century on the basis of Cantor’s work, consists in its unencompassable pluralization of infinite quantities. ‘Cantor’s theorem’, as it is known, can be intuitively glossed as follows: take any set, count its elements, then compare this number to the number of possible groupings of these elements (by two, by three – but there are also groupings ‘by one’, or ‘by all’, which is identical with the whole set). You will always obtain the same result: the set B of possible groupings (or parts) of a set A is always bigger than A – even if A is infinite. It is possible to construct an unlimited succession of infinite sets, each of which is of a quantity superior to that of the set whose parts it collects together. This succession is known as the series of alephs, or the series of transfinite cardinals. But this series itself cannot be totalized, in other words, it cannot be collected together into some ‘ultimate’ quantity. For it is clear that were such a quantitative totalization to exist, then it would also have to allow itself to be surpassed in accordance with the procedure of the grouping of parts. Thus, the set T (for Totality) of all quantities cannot ‘contain’ the quantity obtained by the set of the parts of T. Consequently, this ‘quantity of all quantities’ is not construed as being ‘too big’ to be grasped by thought – it is simply construed as not existing. Within the standard set-theoretical axiomatic, that which is quantifiable, and even more generally, that which is thinkable – which is to say, sets in general, or whatever can be constructed or demonstrated in accordance with the requirement of consistency – does not constitute a totality. For this totality of the thinkable is itself logically inconceivable, since it gives rise to a contradiction. We will retain the following translation of Cantor’s transfinite: the (quantifiable) totality of the thinkable is unthinkable. </p>

        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Ergo, (C). Because of (B), stability without necessity is coherent, and the world may remain uniform indefinitely, but no reason forces it to do so. The stability of the laws we actually find is actually a brute fact that demands no reason beyond its occurrence; its persistence may be long, but it is never necessary. We can prove that an idea of some particular entity being ontically necessary is impossible, but also assert that that ontological contingency is necessary. That can be done without upgrading any contingent regularity or modal profile for physical laws to a necessary one. This is the core of Meillassoux’s 'principle of unreason' and the bridge to hyper-chaos — a time capable, without cause or reason, of overturning any physical law whatsoever. </p>  
        
        <p>It is on this basis that Meillassoux tackles Hume: we can explain why there is no a priori bar to a hundred different outcomes from what we presently call the same cause, and we can do so without sliding into an anthropomorphic story about conventional witnesses or impressions. The planet does not wait for us to fix a reference class, and the world’s temporality houses its own capacity to be otherwise. Mathematics thereby regains a non-correlational role of licensing witness-independent truths (the literal content of ancestral science) without reinstalling metaphysical absolutes or guarantees. Philosophy’s task, in this view, is to remain faithful to science’s speculative reach, re-absolutizing mathematics as discourse of the outside, while refusing both the principle of sufficient reason and any theology or anti-theology that claims necessity where there is, and can be, none. </p>
        
        <h2>Immanence</h2>
        <p>I have one issue with Meillassoux. According to him, if some correlationist says that every X is always X-for-us, his realism seems blocked. Yet immanence (e.g., the Spinozan, Nietzschean or Deleuzean philosophy), can actually avoid the trap by refusing the dichotomy. If what presents itself is not ‘for-us’ but ‘from-outside’, where ‘outside’ means other bodies, fields, and processes impinging on a system to produce determinate effects, that would make events exterior to recognition without being external to being…</p>
        
        <p>My personal view is a midpoint between immanence and transcendence. On the one hand, I think everything can be produced immanently, as processes and changes in life itself. Even in mathematics, different lenses pick out different modes of production (ex. the calculus of variations captures constraints as stationary actions, while categorical or topos-theoretic frameworks internalize logics suited to the structures at hand). But I also think that mathematics, alone, has a truly double-aspect between the immanent and something close to Platonic transcendence, though not completely, being a Hermes-figure doubling between a creative logos (not by humans), an expression of the ground of possibility, and the world. However, that’s a topic for another essay! </p>
        
        <p> Well, I don’t think my personal understanding on immanence bears on the next sections, so it’s fine to just make the comparison. </p>

        <h2>Where Price Comes In</h2>
        <p>In contrast to Meillassoux’s attack on necessity, Hume’s problem returns in Price’s book as a choice forced by Bell’s theorem: either accept nonlocal influence or abandon a background assumption that measurement choices are probabilistically independent of the earlier microstate of the system…</p>
        
        <p>To begin with, let’s look at the usual story: the academic consensus has assumed locality and statistical independence as axioms, using it to derive an inequality, observe its violation, and infer action-at-a-distance. This only looks irresistible only because we read independence as ‘innocent’ and causation as one-way, but if we keep locality and relax independence by allowing later settings to help fix certain otherwise-underdetermined earlier variables along their past light cones, the supposed dilemma dissolves. Crucially, this is a retrocausality in which the measurement coupling itself induces a zigzag through spacetime, with the relevant upstream magnitudes sitting precisely where relativity permits influences to meet. The mathematics is the same, but the metaphysics changes: we trade a preferred frame for a bidirectional dependency that never enables signaling, never licenses paradox, and never threatens the practical autonomy of agents. </p>
        
        <p>Price's claim is that the idea that ‘the past is fixed, the future open’ is an anthropocentric projection. Because our deliberation holds fixed what is available as input while treating downstream outcomes as the target of control, we compress a perspectival divide (inputs fixed, outputs open) into a metaphysical arrow, and then read that arrow back into microphysics as if nature itself guaranteed it. Yet once we step to the Archimedean ‘nowhen’, backward dependencies can exist without being exploitable, since what would need to be touched to ‘bilk’ the effect — hidden upstream variables — cannot be both revealed and kept in the very configuration that the later choice helps to constrain. Consequently, the everyday misconception of agency survives intact. </p>
      
        <p>This reorientation matters for Hume. One, if the quantum correlations admit a local, retrocausal reading, then the pressure to postulate nonlocal necessities evaporates, and with it the temptation to find in physics a lawlike compulsion for the arrow of influence. Two, if perceptions of causal directionality are tied to our macroscopic role in a thermodynamic environment, then the familiar inference from forward-looking practice to forward-directed necessity is a category mistake, one that Price’s “nowhen” stance helps us avoid. Thus Hume’s negative lesson, that reason reveals no necessary tie enforcing tomorrow’s resemblance to today, remains in place at the fundamental level, but the positive lesson, that we are entitled to rely on stable conventions, reappears only at the macroscopic level as an ecological fact about agents embedded in worlds with arrows. </p>
      
        <p>Basically, whereas Meillassoux secures the modal space by showing that stability requires no reason beyond consistency, Price secures the semantic space by showing that the felt direction of support is a feature of practice, not a boundary condition of being. </p>
      
        <h2>Bridging the Two</h2>
        <p>If, according to Meillassoux, we genuinely have an ability to influence the world outside our own perceptions, then nothing rules out free will being genuine features of the world rather than mere projections of habit; however, it is obscured by our anthropocentric projections which, paradoxically, block us from noticing our real freedom.</p>
        
        <p>First, nothing in reason enforces a picture on which the micro-world is sealed by necessary laws that leave agency as mere epiphenomenon. At the microscopic level, freedom genuinely does not owe its reality to a built-in forward arrow, so recognizing retro-dependence simply extends what we imagine macroscopically to the microscopic world. As a result, the illusion of macroscopic agency and time, which sustains our illusion of free will, is maintained in practice, but in reality the real gain is in theory, which is an independence from an asymmetrical time-arrow. </p>

        <p>From here free will becomes clear. Within a world with laws stable enough to underwrite prediction but never necessary, and whose micro-dynamics allow carefully circumscribed backward dependencies that cannot be exploited for signaling, agency can be understood as counterfactual sensitivity of outcomes to presently available interventions. That sensitivity is not diminished by acknowledging retro-dependence; on the contrary, once the forward-only template is dropped, we realize that nothing in the metaphysics compels laws that would close the space of alternative possibilities. </p>

        <p>In sum, read together, Meillassoux and Price deliver an objective view on which freedom does not beg the world for a necessary order or for a single, ontic arrow. Meillassoux secures the mind-independent contingency within which agency can matter; Price shows why the felt forwardness of choice is a projection of our asymmetric situation rather than a constraint on the micro. I believe the right conclusion is not that free will is a perspectival mistake, but that, once the perspective is properly located, freedom at the micro-level keeps its license. How? It steers the future in the ordinary way, and, where physics permits, it resonates backward in a form too subtle to be weaponized, yet real enough to reconcile locality, Hume’s lesson, and our joyful situation of immanence, potential, choice, and freedom. </p>
      
        <h2>Appendix 1: Set Theory</h2>
        <p>I have one criticism regarding Meillassoux’s usage of mathematics, specifically set theory, in his otherwise good book…</p>
        
        <p>I think Meillassoux treats ‘mathematics’ far too narrowly, leaning on select areas such as axiomatic set theory, then exports results from those niches as if they held with the same force outside their original technical context. </p>

        <p>What he mentioned is local to a particular foundational program and a classical logic, while large swathes of contemporary mathematics proceed with different commitments. Classical ZFC is powerful, but much of modern mathematics isn’t tied to classical ZFC set theory at all. In topos theory, the internal logic is typically intuitionistic, so the law of excluded middle need not hold, and you only recover classical logic in special ‘Boolean’ toposes. In constructive foundations such as Constructive Zermelo–Fraenkel or type theory, not every collection of sub-objects is assumed to form a set. Hence, ‘the set of all subsets’ is replaced by power-objects (in a topos) or subtypes (in type theory) that classify definable parts. Relatedly, size and totality are handled differently: category theory and type theory use hierarchies of universes (no ‘set of all sets’), and even in classical set theory global totalities (like a set of all ordinals) are provably impossible or independent of the axioms. </p>

        <p>When Meillassoux infers from a set-theoretic fact to a universal constraint on scientific modality, he assumes those foundations stand for everything else. If Meillassoux wants Cantorian non-totalizability to carry metaphysical necessity, he owes an argument that it survives across logics and foundations, not just in the one that best suits his conclusion. A better route would show that across plausible mathematical frameworks the same methodological prohibition on certain probabilistic inferences holds, and then argue that this methodological point, not Cantor specifically, is what blocks the frequential inference to logical necessity. </p>
      
        <p>Alan Sokal famously criticized many postmodern philosophers for poor understanding of mathematics. For example, he said that Lacan invokes topological surfaces to explain neurosis/psychosis without any articulated mapping, so the math functions as prestige décor rather than an analytic tool. According to Lacan, ‘a torus, a Klein bottle, a cross-cap [...] And this diversity is very important as it explains many things about the structure of mental disease’, and Sokal would ask: well, what are the correspondences between surface features and symptom profiles, then? </p>  

        <p>Lacan is fine. For myself, when I read, I can sympathize with how Lacan is using these as metaphors within a symbolic system, not as claims about mathematics per se — it’s fun to see math everywhere. I don’t mind Lacan, because he’s not using it as his actual argument, just giving his writing some ‘spice’. But it’s different for the case of Meillassoux. Clearly it’s more than metaphor in After Finitude — it’s the actual justification for his whole logical structure. But then it would be better done with the accurate mathematical depth wouldn’t it? Sokal has a real point in criticizing the Meillassoux case, but not necessarily in the cases of Lacan. </p>
      
        <p>If anyone thinks it’s too much demand to respect the depth of other fields when writing philosophy, just think the reverse: In The Grand Design, Stephen Hawking infamously claimed that ‘philosophy is dead’ because every question about causation can apparently be answered with experimentation. Without doubt, to anyone who has read basic philosophy, that is a naive claim, because ‘philosophy is dead’ is a philosophical claim itself! Hawking doesn’t know philosophy but pretends he can speak for it, which makes even an accomplished theoretical physicist sound ignorant. Luckily it doesn’t affect the main point of his book, not being the fulcrum of his argument (unlike Meillassoux talking about math), so I can overlook it. In short, if you intend to use other fields as an actual argument, the demand for respecting its depth goes both ways. Study more, do your research, and that’s the only way you won’t write with ignorance. This goes for everything. </p>
      
        <h2>Appendix 2: Deleuze</h2>
        <p>Continued from the immanence section, I think Deleuze was unfairly targeted by Meillassoux as some form of covert correlationlist.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p> A metaphysics of this type may select from among various forms of subjectivity, but it is invariably characterized by the fact that it hypostatizes some mental, sentient, or vital term: representation in the Leibnizian monad; Schelling’s Nature, or the objective subject-object; Hegelian Mind; Schopenhauer’s Will; the Will (or Wills) to Power in Nietzsche; perception loaded with memory in Bergson; Deleuze’s Life, etc. Even in those cases where the vitalist hypostatization of the correlation (as in Nietzsche or Deleuze) is explicitly identified with a critique of ‘the subject’ or of ‘metaphysics’, it shares with speculative idealism the same twofold decision which ensures its irreducibility to naïve realism or some variant of transcendental idealism: </p>
          <footer>— <cite><em>After Finitude</em></cite>, p. 37</footer>
        </blockquote>
       
        <p>In the work of Deleuze, the conditions of experience come from outside us, as traces of an exterior reality that produces what we live through, rather than from a subject that legislates in advance what counts as experience. In other words, real conditions ‘tear’ the conditioned, as forces that de-subjectivize us, so that subjectivity appears as an effect of material processes rather than their premise. From these interactions arise incorporeal effects such as time, sense, even consciousness, that have their own quasi-causality, but they happen without presupposing a subject. His ‘transcendental empiricism’ is more production than projection. </p>
        
        <p>Sure, I wouldn’t classify Deleuze as a traditional ‘realist’ like Meillassoux, being antagonistic to eternal truths (both Aristotle and Plato, in different styles), but Meillassoux’s point of contention was the supposed correlationism of Deleuze, not how he wasn’t realist enough — which is not an apt criticism. For Deleuze, laws would be local organizing principles sifted from an immanent chaos whose determinations flash and vanish. It is not contradictory to Meillassoux’s claim. </p>
      
        <p>In conclusion, Deleuze’s sits nearer to Meillassoux than the latter’s polemics suggest: both secure exteriority via contingency, but where Meillassoux states it as a speculative absolute, Deleuze insists we encounter it in experience, as the event that forces new rules. Either way, the absolute is not guaranteed by a meta-law, but it is contacted where production outruns recognition. Meillassoux could do better. </p>
