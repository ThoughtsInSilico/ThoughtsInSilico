        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This is a double-book-review of two philosophy books, each of which has different focuses, but make a related point on anthropocentrism.</p>
        <p>As a short synopsis, Meillassoux’s book speaks from his position of a metaphysical realist — he has a notion that absolute knowledge is possible. Price, meanwhile, is an anti-realist, who believes in utility much more than, well, ‘truth’. However, both books point out the problem in not distinguishing between “how things are” and “how we talk about things”, and how they relate to a symmetric view of physical laws.</p>
        <p>The most meaningful way to read Meillassoux alongside Price is that they expose a similar contradiction: that humans tend to speak of reality as if our mode of access is a condition for what there is, confusing laws of thought or practice with laws of nature. In other words, they both warn us against our habit of mistaking a parochial standpoint for a structure of reality.</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>In <em>After Finitude</em>, Meillassoux dismantles the correlationist<a href="#note1">[1]</a> claim that we can speak only of the Kantian correlation between thought and being. He pushes for the “Great Outdoors” — the absolute — and the demand for thinking a world without us and, crucially, a world in which the stability of law is not necessary.</li>
          <li>In <em>Time’s Arrow and Archimedes’ Point</em>, Price argues for a view of time that is symmetrical at the microlevel, and that many asymmetries we take to be features of the world are actually features of agents like us. The task becomes to separate objective temporal structure from artifacts of agency and deliberation.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>My point, however, is about free will. Read together, these two books suggest that the idea that free will must aim forward is a projection of our asymmetric position as agents — true free will goes both ways microscopically, in the actual world.</p>
